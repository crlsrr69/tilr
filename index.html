              <h5>The sensation of like someone can be both exciting and perplexing. As I begin to think about her more frequently, my thoughts turn to what she might be doing or how she might be feeling. It's as though her presence in my life offers an unfathomable sense of love and contentment. The fact that I smile when I think about her is a strong indication that I am developing affections for her. At times, these emotions might be overwhelming, making it impossible to concentrate on anything else.
                Only time will tell where this attraction may lead me, but for the time being, all I know is that I adore the way she makes me feel.</h5>
